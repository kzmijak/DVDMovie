Sample ASP .NET / Anguler web app

**DISCLAIMER**

This project is fully based on R. Adolphe's "Hands-on Web Development with ASP.NET Core & Angular 7" course. 

Shortly after finalizing the works on this project there should started a new project that I am going to develop myself using the knowledge I gained during the lessons.

**ISSUES**

Due to relatively dated structure of the code written by Mr. Adolphe, some issues may occur, to which I take partial responsibility. 


**IMPORTANT INFO**

To access shopping cart please follow the instructions below"

1. Choose movies to add to the cart

2. On the right side of the navigation bar should be a price string. Move the cursor slightly to the right and the icon of the cursor should change. Please click the LMB and you should proceed to the shopping page.

Sorry for the inconvenience, the issue remains due to the fact, that the package containing the icon responsible for redirecting to the cart page, seems highly incompatible with the current version of the software and causes severe stability issues when used.
